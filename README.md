"Clean" Onion Architecture based high performance Go Rest Framework built on Echo

Currently, this is a WIP as existing progress has been halted by rearchitecting based on 
the knowledge and benefits of using the Onion Architecture described here:
https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html

To provide for better usability and make this a framework that can be used by more people
that is module agnostic, this framework will be remade to use it.

Benefits include:
- Extremely modular code that allows for seperation between logic and external tools
- Easily testable
- Easily migratable
- Usable in a Monorepo (Single repository - Google style)
